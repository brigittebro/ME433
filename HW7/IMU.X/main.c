 * When you get the correct response from WHOAMI, 
 * write an I2CmultipleRead() function to be able 
 * to read many registers in a row. 
 * Read all of the temperature, gyroscope, and 
 * accelerometer data registers, 
 * and shift them into signed shorts 
 * (temperature, gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ, accelX, accelY, accelZ).

Read the LSM6DS33 at 20 Hz, and blink your LED as a heartbeat. Draw bars starting from the center of the LCD in the direction of the chip +X and +Y directions. Scale the length of the bars to match the readings from the accelerometer. It may help to write the text values of the readings as you debug.
